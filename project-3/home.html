    <h1>Thoughts</h1>
        <u><h1>Week 1</h1></u>
        <p>When I was reading this article, I was honestly surprised to learn just how far back computer art goes, with the themes of merging an amalgamation of concepts and technologies at the helm of it all. It's no surprise that women were also pioneering a lot of this movement, and newfound form of expression that was a sign of the turning and evolving times. I liked the part where it noted that these artists gained access to computer use by negotiating with large-scale companies. It really drives in the point that this was not seen as lucrative or perhaps legitimate at the time. I loved the work by the art collective art(n) entitled "virtual implants." For me, the piece says many things and has many implications that rise to the surface when the piece is made from a digital platform, unable to be 3-dimensionally explored, like a traditional sculpture. Visually it's also very stunning through the shapes and intersection of colors--I'm appreciative of the "glitch" that may have been unavoidable with the resolution at the time, but now it becomes emblematic of the past.</p>
        
        <u><h1>Week 2</h1></u>
        <p>My first reaction to the article was its title--"Black Gooey Universe"--which immediately pulled me in, and I would assume pulls most readers in who consider themselves within the art/tech world. I also did not know that computer monitors used to be black. Like the article mentions, this also serves as a metaphor for the progression of anti-blackness in technology, which we have seen from the employment and lack of transparency for anti-racist work within the tech sphere, at the working level and beyond. A lot of the themes mentioned have really strong roots, and create a visual landscape for a subtle and almost learned-innate standard and status for what is expected through netizens for how tech should look and present--white. I also find it a little humorous but unfortunately true that the conceptualization and birth of silicon valley was out of cishet white males to essentially spew their ideas in regards to the blooming nature of technology while simultaneously going unchecked and unshifted. </p>
        
         <u><h1>Week 3</h1></u>
        <p>This article made me really intrigued on essentially the shroud that covers the internet and all of the spaces within it. I really like the idea of the anonymity that the internet provides, and sometimes it disguises itself as many other things than a government-controlled media landscape, but it can also be the antithesis of that should you delve into the corners that lie beyond—it’s just hard to find. She brought up an interesting point about YouTube vlogs, and how companies like target are essentially speaking to us directly, by way of a 15 year old girl that they use as a vessel and a vehicle to get their messages of sales and capitalistic allusiveness across. I never really thought about the ways the internet probably impacted my childhood, and how it made somme interactions more forgettable and/or memorable. I also thought about how it has affected my interactions with the day-to-day real life world, where you have to maintain a facade of composure when you really want to say much more many times, you’re out in the open and that courage is dampened. I hadn’t thought too much about that before! It also brings up sometimes a sad point about how the longing for connection and yearning for someone to talk to is fulfilled by a screen in which no one truly knows each other, and their paths will most likely never cross. </p>
        
        <u><h1>Week 4</h1></u>
        <p>This video prompted me to think a lot about surveillance as well as invasion, which are some topics I've had interest in for a while--but the way in which Lauren talks about these dystopian concepts and turns them into art is really useful for her practice, and makes the situation's dynamic shift and become something completely different. I especially liked how her piece kind of tied into the themes of being watched or followed, coupled with the feelings of perhaps having one's agency taken away byway of surveillance. Her piece and work also reminded me of the other reading that had to due with Black women being victims of surveillance. I never thought about how big tech will invade privacy in order to work a case against a certain demographic without said demographic's consent. </p>
        
        <u><h1>Week 5</h1></u>
        <p>I really enjoyed this week's reading, and it brought about a lot of topics within my day-to-day poor image viewing and use that I had no idea linked itself to the hierarchical nature of the arts that have become bourgeoisie to serve the world at large. I love the idea of poor images becoming essentially metaphors for life, the cyclical nature as well as the reuse and the transferring. They change their landscapes based on where they're going and being distributed, as well as take on new meanings and visual cues. I really like the idea of a visual bond, and how ours today would be a link to the present--the author also mentions how poor images are also intentionally used as an aesthetic choice, which seems to pay homage to the fact of their reshaping and remixing, which in turn completely transforms their ability for interpretation. Poor images in this way also become symbols, icons, and visually clearer, despite their 'quality.'</p>
        
         <u><h1>Week 6</h1></u>
        <p>The topic of algorithmic bias has always been heavy on my mind as someone who works with technology and the concepts of privacy, as well as representation within technology. I knew a bit about what Joy was speaking on, and knew that the pool of examples that are given to the machines and data aren’t that diverse, so it in turn creates a void where many other faces and representations should be recognized. However, I wasn’t aware of the fact that it is actually a pretty simple change—it goes into the larger conversation of how white supremacy dominates even niche creative spheres—but it’s up to individuals who work with this technology to provide better examples of how individuals that could participate in experiments and facial recognition look. It’s a little disheartening to see a Black woman like Joy having to be the one to tell people this is a problem, however. It makes me wonder how long this has been swept under the rug by nonblack creatives and counterparts. </p>
        
        <u><h1>Week 7</h1></u>
        <p>The topics brought about in the reading and the TED talk are intricately intertwined. When designing, it’s really important to sort of forgo the more sinister and insidious parts of design that have a negative effect on the user and in turn the designer. Coding and using immaterial as an escape instead of control and gain over a single storyline is the most important thing a designer can embody, which leads into Chimamanda’s points of the burden of a single story. There is no one right way to experience a situation, and it looks different for everything else and everyone else, even if the exterior may take the same form. What’s hiding inside is something only the individual can recite. When we are only fed one idea of a way to do something, our design and our approach becomes narrow and exclusive to a few who aren’t the ones benefiting from the output anyway. </p>
        
       <u><h1>Week 8</h1></u>
        <p>Ari Melenciano brought up many points that stuck with me, and ones I'll take with me into the future as a designer who is conscious of the spaces I inhabit, and where I draw a lot of my inspiration from. Designing 'with' and not 'for' is something I never really considered--it was such a light seeing her illuminate a profoundly important and necessary sentiment that designers often overlook or don't even take into account at all. I think the concept tackles the topic of rejecting the notion that a designer is the know-all and be-all, especially when the communities that we have in mind while designing have their own sets of knowledge and indigenous tools/resistance that we need to be careful of overstepping or silencing, but rather working in close connection with, weaving in and out of to carve a miraculous being that forms its own entity. It's being able to step back and let the communities have their own say in the matter, teaching the designer tools as well, as they might know just as much in a different fashion. Creating your own space to prevent inhibition in the world of design is something I'm excited to see a lot of artists and designers alike doing, and art as a form of resistance and decolonization is important now more than ever, because of how multifaceted it is and what it can take on. I'm truly inspired by Ari's efforts and synthesizing of concepts. The way she articulates how to design ethically and how to function within your own space and the need for that through a community standpoint is and of itself one of the most powerful forms of existing as an inherently political identity.</p>
